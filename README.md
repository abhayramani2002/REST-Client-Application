# REST-Client-Application

## Install the Client Dependencies(npm i)

## Install the Server Dependencies(npm i)

## In the Server Directory there's a index.js file. Change the value of mongodb url inside the file. Set the value as your mongodb connection url.

## If want to change the port of Client or Server just change it at .env file.

## Now start the server by npm/yarn start

## Now start the react by npm/yarn start
